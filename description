The Problem Statement: 
Write a Python function that performs several text analysis operations on my full name
(first name, middle name if any, and last name). The function should do the following:
 1. Count and display the number of vowels and consonants in my full name.
 2. Display the ASCII value of each character in my name.
 3. Reverse my full name and display the reversed version.
 4. Check if my name is a palindrome, for example: it reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces and case).
 5. Store each unique character from my name into a Python list and sort it alphabetically.

Technologies Used: Python Programming Language
